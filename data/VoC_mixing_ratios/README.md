# Basic Information about the monitored VoCs

Following VoCs have been monitored by the PTR-MS at *20 second* intervals.

> **m33** - Methanol
>> OVOC - emitted directly by plants

> **m42** - Acetonitrile
>> tracer of biomass burning

> **m45** - Acetaldehyde
>> OVOC - can be directly emitted by plants or wood as it can be an oxidation product also from BVOCs

> **m59** - Acetone
>> OVOC - this will come from the GC

> **m61** - Acetic acid
>> mainly secondary product from BVOCs

> **m63** - DMS
>> Oceanic tracer - mainly emitted from algae in the sea

> **m69** - Isoprene
>> natural hydrocarbon - biogenic molecule

> **m71** - MVK+MACR
>> OVOC - products of isoprene degradation

> **m73** - MEK
>> OVOC - can be primary or secondary, can be anthropogenic and biogenic

> **m79** - Benzene
>> anthropogenic hydrocarbon

> **m81** - terpenes
>> natural hydrocarbon - fragment of m137, sum of monoterpenes (C10H16)

> **m93** - Toluene
>> anthropogenic hydrocarbon

> **m107** - sum of Xylenes
>> anthropogenic hydrocarbon

> **m121** - Trimethylbenzene
>> anthropogenic hydrocarbon

> **m137** - sum of Monoterpenes
>> natural hydrocarbon - the instrument loses sensitivity for larger masses, so we generally look at its fragment, m81.
